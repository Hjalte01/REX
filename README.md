# Robotic Experiments(rex) - Short guide

Might have to fiddel with the last digit of the ip and use the

```
ping <ip>
```

command to find the correct ip-address to connect from the pc and robot.

## Usefull information:

id:

```
ssh pi@172.20.10.5
```

password:

```
DIKU4Ever
```

github repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:Hjalte01/Robotic_Experiments-rex-.git
```

Afterwards git push and pull is enough.
